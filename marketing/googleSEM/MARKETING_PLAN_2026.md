## Part 1: What's Wrong (Diagnosis)

### 1.1 Campaign Structure Issues

**Problem**: Destination-specific ad groups aren't converting despite high CTRs.

| Ad Group | Clicks | CTR | Spend | Conversions |
|----------|--------|-----|-------|-------------|
| Thailand eSIM | 35 | 21.60% | A$219.58 | 0 |
| Japan eSIM | 20 | 9.57% | A$123.96 | 0 |
| Asia eSIM (paused) | 44 | 7.97% | A$251.56 | 0 |
| Travel eSIM - General | 133 | 5.01% | A$601.06 | 3 |

**Insight**: High CTR + Zero conversions = Landing page or pricing problem, not keyword problem.

### 1.2 Pricing Problem (Critical)

Your current advertised prices in ads don't match competitor reality:

| Destination | Your Price (ads) | Airalo | Holafly | Saily |
|-------------|------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| Japan 7-day | A$24.99 | A$7 (1GB) - A$42 (unlimited) | A$42 | A$6 (1GB) |
| Thailand 7-day | A$19.99 | A$6 (1GB) - A$31 (unlimited) | A$42 | A$5 (1GB) |
| Indonesia 7-day | A$19.99 | A$6 (1GB) - A$30 (unlimited) | A$30 | A$5 (1GB) |

**Issue**: You're positioned in the "premium" zone but without premium differentiation. Customers search, see your price, then compare with Airalo's entry prices.

### 1.3 Keyword Strategy Issues

Current keywords are too broad:
- `[thailand esim]` - High intent but includes price-shoppers
- `[asia esim]` - Too broad, low purchase intent
- `[travel esim]` - Generic, attracts researchers

Missing high-intent keywords:
- `buy japan esim` - Transactional intent
- `japan esim unlimited data` - Feature-specific
- `esim australia to japan` - Origin-specific (your market!)

### 1.4 Ad Copy Issues

Current ads emphasize:
- "Instant QR Code" (every competitor says this)
- "Unlimited Data" (competitors are cheaper for this)
- Price anchors that aren't competitive

Missing differentiators:
- "Australian Support" (unique!)
- Specific data amounts
- Trust signals (reviews, guarantees)

---

## Part 2: Pricing Strategy Revision

### 2.1 Recommended Price Points (AUD)

Based on competitor analysis and your margin requirements:

#### Option A: Value Leader Strategy (Recommended)

Position as the best value for Australian travelers:

| Destination | 5-Day | 7-Day | 15-Day | vs. Airalo |
|-------------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| Japan | A$18.99 | A$24.99 | A$39.99 | 10% cheaper |
| Thailand | A$14.99 | A$19.99 | A$34.99 | 15% cheaper |
| Indonesia | A$14.99 | A$19.99 | A$34.99 | 15% cheaper |
| Singapore | A$12.99 | A$17.99 | A$29.99 | 10% cheaper |
| Vietnam | A$12.99 | A$17.99 | A$29.99 | 10% cheaper |
| Malaysia | A$12.99 | A$17.99 | A$29.99 | 10% cheaper |
| South Korea | A$18.99 | A$24.99 | A$39.99 | 10% cheaper |

**Margin Analysis** (assuming A$8-12 wholesale for 7-day unlimited):
- A$19.99 retail = 67-150% margin
- A$24.99 retail = 108-212% margin

#### Option B: Premium with Differentiation

Keep current prices but add tangible value:
- Money-back guarantee (first in market)
- 24/7 Australian phone support
- Setup video calls included
- Extended validity (+3 days free)

#### Option C: Tiered Data (Like Airalo)

Offer multiple data options per destination:

| Japan | Price |
|-------|-------|
| 3GB / 7 days | A$9.99 |
| 10GB / 7 days | A$19.99 |
| Unlimited / 7 days | A$29.99 |

**Recommendation**: Start with Option A, test Option C for Japan/Thailand.

### 2.2 Landing Page Price Display

Update destination pages to show:

```
Japan eSIM from A$9.99
├── 3GB / 7 days: A$9.99 (Light use)
├── 10GB / 7 days: A$19.99 (Most popular)
└── Unlimited / 7 days: A$29.99 (Heavy use)
```

This captures price-sensitive traffic AND upsells.

### 3.2 Priority Order (Budget Allocation)

| Priority | Campaign | Daily Budget | Rationale |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Japan | A$30/day | Highest search volume from AU |
| 2 | Thailand | A$25/day | Second most popular |
| 3 | Bali/Indonesia | A$20/day | Strong AU demand |
| 4 | General Travel | A$15/day | Catches broad intent |
| 5 | Other destinations | A$10/day | Long-tail |

**Total**: A$100/day = A$3,000/month

### 3.3 Keyword Strategy by Intent

#### Transactional (Highest value - prioritize)
```
[buy japan esim]
[order japan sim card]
[japan esim purchase]
[get esim for japan]
[japan esim online]
```

#### Feature-Specific (High value)
```
[japan esim unlimited data]
[japan esim 5g]
[japan esim ntt docomo network]
[japan esim instant delivery]
```

#### Destination + Origin (Very high value - UNIQUE TO YOU)
```
[japan esim for australians]
[australia to japan esim]
[australian esim japan]
[telstra roaming alternative japan]
[optus roaming japan cheaper]
```

#### Competitor (Medium value)
```
[airalo alternative australia]
[cheaper than holafly]
[airalo japan esim review]
[best esim provider australia]
```

### 3.4 Negative Keywords (Expanded)

## Part 10: Competitive Response Plan

- Add comparison landing page

### If New Competitor Enters AU Market
- Monitor their messaging
- Defend on brand terms
- Double down on trust/support messaging

### Seasonal Adjustments
| Period | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Dec-Jan | Increase Japan budget (ski season) |
| Apr-May | Increase Thailand/Bali (school holidays) |
| Jun-Jul | Increase Europe (winter escape) |

---

## Appendix: Sample GAQL Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Top performing keywords by conversion
SELECT
  ad_group.name,
  ad_group_criterion.keyword.text,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.conversions_value
FROM keyword_view
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
  AND metrics.conversions > 0
ORDER BY metrics.conversions DESC

-- Search terms with no conversions (potential negatives)
SELECT
  search_term_view.search_term,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.cost_micros
FROM search_term_view
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
  AND metrics.clicks > 5
  AND metrics.conversions = 0
ORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC
```

---

## Summary

The core issues are:
1. **Pricing perception** - You're positioned premium without premium value
2. **Campaign structure** - Destination ad groups lack conversion intent keywords
3. **Landing pages** - Need trust signals and clearer pricing tiers

**Expected Results with This Plan**:
- Month 1: Break even (ROAS ~100%)
- Month 2: Profitable (ROAS ~200%)
- Month 3+: Scale profitably (ROAS ~300%+)
