## 10 Customer Review Options

### Review 1 - Japan Business Traveller
**Name:** Sarah M. | **Location:** Sydney, NSW | **Destination:** Japan
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Lifesaver for my Tokyo business trip. Had the eSIM set up on my iPhone before I even left Sydney. Landed at Narita and was connected instantly - no hunting for SIM card vending machines. Data was fast enough for video calls with the office. The Australian support team responded within minutes when I had a setup question. Will definitely use again for my next trip."

**Best for:** Business traveller angle, iPhone user, Australian support emphasis

### Review 2 - Thailand Family Holiday
**Name:** David & Michelle R. | **Location:** Melbourne, VIC | **Destination:** Thailand
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Used Trvel for our 2-week family holiday in Thailand - Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Phuket. Set up eSIMs on 4 phones before we left. Kids could use Google Maps, we could book Grab rides, and stayed connected the whole trip. So much easier than the chaos of buying SIMs at the airport with jetlagged kids. Saved us heaps compared to Telstra roaming."

**Best for:** Family travel, multiple devices, cost savings vs Telstra

### Review 3 - Bali Solo Traveller
**Name:** Jess T. | **Location:** Brisbane, QLD | **Destination:** Bali, Indonesia
**Rating:** 5/5

> "First time using an eSIM and was a bit nervous, but the setup guide made it super easy. Worked perfectly in Bali - Seminyak, Ubud, and even Nusa Penida. Could post to Insta, video call home, and use Google Maps without worrying about data. Australian-owned company was a plus for me."

**Best for:** First-time eSIM user, solo female traveller, social media use

---

### Review 4 - Japan Snow Trip
**Name:** Chris L. | **Location:** Perth, WA | **Destination:** Japan
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Took this to Niseko and Hakuba for the ski season. Worked perfectly even up in the mountains. Used it to check snow reports, find restaurants, and keep the family group chat updated with powder photos. QR code came through in about 2 minutes after I bought it. No dramas at all."

**Best for:** Ski/snow season, remote mountain areas, quick delivery

---

### Review 5 - Singapore Stopover
**Name:** Amanda K. | **Location:** Adelaide, SA | **Destination:** Singapore
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Had a 3-day stopover in Singapore before flying to Europe. The eSIM was perfect - didn't want to buy a physical SIM for just a few days. Set it up on the flight over (downloaded the QR code earlier) and activated the moment we landed at Changi. Great value for a short trip."

**Best for:** Short trips/stopovers, value for money

---

### Review 6 - Vietnam Backpacker
**Name:** Tom H. | **Location:** Gold Coast, QLD | **Destination:** Vietnam
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Backpacked through Vietnam for a month - Hanoi, Hoi An, Ho Chi Minh, and everywhere in between. The eSIM worked the whole time with solid coverage. Used it for Grab, Google Translate (essential!), and hostel bookings. Much easier than trying to sort a SIM in a foreign country when you don't speak the language."

**Best for:** Long-term travel, backpackers, language barrier angle

---

### Review 7 - Korea K-Pop Fan Trip
**Name:** Emily W. | **Location:** Sydney, NSW | **Destination:** South Korea
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Went to Seoul for concerts and needed reliable data for Naver Map (Google Maps doesn't work well there!), KakaoTalk, and live streaming. The eSIM worked brilliantly - fast 5G speeds everywhere. My friend bought a SIM at Incheon and it took her an hour. I was connected in 2 minutes."

**Best for:** Young travellers, K-pop/Korean culture, 5G speed, airport comparison

---

### Review 8 - Malaysia Family Visit
**Name:** Raj P. | **Location:** Melbourne, VIC | **Destination:** Malaysia
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Visit family in KL every year. Used to buy a Maxis SIM each time but this year tried Trvel's eSIM. So much more convenient - set up before I left and worked from the moment I landed. Covered Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and even Langkawi with no issues. 24/7 support when I had a question too."

**Best for:** VFR (visiting friends & relatives), repeat traveller, regional coverage

---

### Review 9 - Multi-Country Asia Trip
**Name:** Ben & Lisa C. | **Location:** Canberra, ACT | **Destination:** Japan, Thailand, Bali
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Did a 3-week multi-stop trip through Asia. Got separate eSIMs for Japan, Thailand, and Bali. Each one worked perfectly in its country. The ability to have multiple eSIMs on one phone is a game changer. Way better than swapping physical SIMs and keeping track of them. Highly recommend."

**Best for:** Multi-country itinerary, eSIM advantages, organised travellers

---

### Review 10 - Last-Minute Business Trip
**Name:** Michael S. | **Location:** Sydney, NSW | **Destination:** Thailand
**Rating:** 5/5

> "Got called to Bangkok with 24 hours notice for work. Ordered the eSIM at 10pm, had the QR code in my email in 2 minutes, and was set up before bed. No stress about finding data when I landed for an 8am meeting. Exactly what I needed. Australian company, instant delivery, just works."

**Best for:** Last-minute travel, business urgency, instant delivery emphasis
